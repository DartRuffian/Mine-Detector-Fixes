## Mine Detector Fixes
**Version 0.0.0**

### Description

A collection of fixes to fix items from various mods breaking vanilla mine detectors. This is a very common error when mods use the vanilla game's `ItemCore` class instead of the `CBA_MiscItem` class from [Community Based Addons](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=450814997). The issue is caused by miscellaneous items actually being mine detectors with a `detectRange` of 0, and modded items sometimes configure values improperly.
